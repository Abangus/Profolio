    <h1 class="delicious">POUTINE</h1>
    <img class="food" src="https://www.hostelworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Ultimate-Guide-to-Canadian-Food-Poutine-@shannondidwhat.jpg">
    <p class="explain">Few Canadian dishes are as world-renowned as the glorious creation known as poutine. Crispy fries, squeaky cheese curds and rich gravy all combine to create the meal of dreams, and this French Canadian food is so popular that it can now be found all around the world. The classic version is great on its own, but toppings like pulled pork, bacon and smoked meat really knock it out of the park – and at an average price of £3.50, it won’t break the bank either.</p>
    <h1 class="delicious">SASKATOON BERRY PIE</h1>
    <img class="food" src="https://www.hostelworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Ultimate-Guide-to-Canadian-Food-Saskatoon-Berry-Pie-@prairieberries.sk_.jpg">
    <p class="explain">The Saskatoon berry is often described as having a sweet and almondy flavour, which makes it an ideal candidate for the perfect pie. Truly, a slice of this will change your life. It’s no wonder the city of Saskatoon was actually named after it, rather than the other way around.</p>
    <h1 class="delicious">CAESAR COCKTAIL</h1>
    <img class="food" src="https://www.hostelworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Ultimate-Guide-to-Canadian-Food-Caesar-cocktail-@newjenesis.jpg">
    <p class="explain">The Caesar is Canada’s national cocktail. Made of vodka, clamato juice, Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce, the Canadian take on the Bloody Mary makes the absolute best brunch companion. Recently, restaurants and bars have stepped up their garnish game to include more than the traditional celery salt rim and celery stalk to include the likes of an entire roast chicken, burgers, hot dogs, sliders, onion rings and more (aka the Checkmate Caesar at the Score on Davie in Vancouver).</p>
